[![Deploy To Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FDBAFahim%2Fsaptable-adf-starter_fahmad%2Fdevinstall%2Fazuredeploy.json)


This template creates an Azure Data Factory that ingests data from a configurable list of SAP table entities into Azure Blob Storage. When you deploy this Azure Resource Manager template, the following entities get created: 

- Azure SQL Database (metadata database)
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Storage linked service 
- Azure SQL Database linked service
- SAP Table linked service
- Azure SQL Database input dataset
- SAP Table input dataset
- Azure Blob output datasets
- Driver and worker pipelines

## Next steps
1. Open the deployed Data Factory 
2. Configure or link the [Integration Runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/connector-sap-table) needed to access the SAP environment
3. Update the [SAP Table Linked Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/connector-sap-table) with the relevant connection details
4. Validate all other linked services and datasets
5. Check and validate the metadata configuration 

## PowerApp deployment
1. Only attemp to install the PowerApp after succesfull deployment of the ADF Accelerator. The PowerApp requires a connection to the metadata database and won't work without it.
2. Download the PowerApp package from the GitHub repository and save on your local computer
3. Open your PowerApp dashboard and choose Apps from the left-hand menu
4. Choose Import Package from the top menu
5. Select the package file
6. For the database connection choose "Select during import" and define a new SQL connection to the metadata database
7. Click import to confirm. The PowerApp will be deployed to your environment.

## TODO
- Azure Key Vault integration
- Deploy behind vnet
- Use Managed Identify to access the Azure Blob and the metadata database
- Integration with CDM format
- Add Synapse Analytics to the deployment
